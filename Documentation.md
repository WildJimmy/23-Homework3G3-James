# **Spring Constant**
The spring constant, denoted as "**k**," is a fundamental property of a spring that quantifies its stiffness or rigidity. It defines the relationship between the force applied to a spring and the amount of deformation (either compression or extension) the spring undergoes in response to that force. In mathematical terms, the spring constant is described by Hooke's Law:
$$F = -kx$$
Where:
- F represents the force applied to the spring, measured in Newtons (N).
- k is the spring constant, measured in Newtons per meter (N/m).
- x is the deformation or displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position, measured in meters (m).

The negative sign indicates that the force exerted by the spring is in the opposite direction of the displacement.

## Experiment Overview:
In this experiment, we use a spring to investigate the relationship between mass and extension, aiming to determine the spring constants and validate Hooke's law.

We placed various masses on the spring and noted its elongations. We collected experimental data with two main variables:

| **Masses (grams)**             | 20   | 40  | 60  | 80    | 100  | 120  |
|--------------------------------|------|-----|-----|-------|------|------|
| **Elongations (centimeters)**  | 2.6  | 5.4 | 8.2 | 10.8  | 13.4 | 16.1 |

To calculate the spring constants (k), we use the formula:
$$k = \frac{mg}{x}$$
By applying this formula to each mass-extension pair, we obtain a set of spring constants.
â€‹After analyzing the experimental data, we calculate the spring constants, resulting in values such as:

7546.15,7266.67,7178.05,7266.67,7320.90,7311.80 dyne/cm

on average we obtain 7298.34 dyne/cm as a spring constant.

Hooke's Law Validation:

We aim to validate Hooke's law, which predicts that the relationship between mass and elongation should yield a straight line on a graph. In our case, we plot a graph of mass (in grams) vs. extension (in centimeters).
